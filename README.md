# nPeoplenJobsProblem
The Job Assignment problem: There are n people who need to be assigned to execute
n jobs, one person per job. (That is, each person is assigned to exactly one job and each job is assigned to exactly one person.) The productivity gain that would be attained if the  ith  person is assigned to the jth job is a known quantity C[i, j] for each pair i, j=0,2,...,n-1. The problem is to find an assignment with the maximum total productivity gain.
 
Design, implement and thoroughly test your own solution for any user specified value of n and any user specified matrix C[i,j]. Use exhaustive search as discussed in class. Think about possible improvements of this algorithm, but do not include them in this assignment.
 
In addition your solution should be designed according to the specifications below:
·         Use exhaustive search discussed in class
·         the solution should work for any user specified input using the format specified in the input files below
·         the solution should be iterative (i.e. non-recursive)
·         the solution should display the solution(s) using the format specified in the sample runs below
·         the solution should count and display the number of job assignments evaluated (do not use a formula to compute!)
